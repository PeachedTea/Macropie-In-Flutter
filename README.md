# MacroPie In Flutter

This is a small project I'm working on to learn the basics of Flutter. My goal is to begin with the reccomended Flutter first app code lab to learn the basics, then apply that knowledge to developing a different simple app. I'll be avoiding the use of Artifical Intelegence and using the Official Documentation as well as other online resources I find helpful. I hope to later also tie in the Ruby on Rails framework and a simple SQL database hosted with Firebase.
